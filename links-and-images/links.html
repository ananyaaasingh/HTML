    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

    <ul>
      <!-- Add <li> elements here -->
        <li>Absolute links, like to
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target="_blank">Mozilla
            Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web
            developers.</li>

            <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras
                page</a>.</li>
             

    </ul>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- 
    a website is just a collection of HTML files organized into folders. To
    refer to those files from inside of another file, the Internet uses “uniform
    resource locators” (URLs). Depending on what you’re referring to, URLs can
    take different forms.

    absolute links
“Absolute” links are the most detailed way you can refer to a web resource. They
start with the “scheme” (typically http:// or https://), followed by the domain
name of the website, then the path of the target web page.

relative links “Relative” links point to another file in your website from the
 vantage point of the file you’re editing. It’s implied that the scheme and
 domain name are the same as the current page, so the only thing you need to
 supply is the path.

root-relative links “Root-relative” links are similar to the previous section,
but instead of being relative to the current page, they’re relative to the
“root” of the entire website. For instance, if your website is hosted on
our-site.com, all root-relative URLs will be relative to our-site.com.
