        <h2>Character Sets</h2>

        <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
<p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should
always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
    yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
    
<p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>

<ol>
  <li>bir</li>
  <li>iki</li>
  <li>üç</li>
  <li>dört</li>
  <li>beş</li>
</ol>

../../elsewhere.html document language A web page’s default language is defined
by the lang attribute on the top-level <html> element. Our document is in
English, so we’ll use the en country code as the attribute value (do this for
all of the pages we created):

<html lang='en'>

character sets A “character set” is kind of like a digital alphabet for your
browser. It’s different from the language of your document in that it only
affects how the letters themselves are rendered, not the language of the
content.
